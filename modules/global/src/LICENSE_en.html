<p>2.2. In consideration of the Licensee agreeing to (and on the condition that the Licensee does throughout the term of this Licence) abide by the terms of this Licence, Haulmont grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence (for the full period of the copyright in the Software commencing on and including the Commencement Date) to use the Software and the Documentation in any country of the world on the terms of this Licence.</p>

<p>2.3. The Licensee may:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2.3.1. download the Software from the <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.com/en" target="_blank">www.cuba-platform.com</a> website along with the Free Licence File or, subject to the payment of the relevant Licence Fee, receive and use such other Licence File as may be provided to the Licensee by Haulmont as a result of the Licence Fee paid;</p>

Otherwise, the Software (and any Third Party Libraries and Forks distributed with it) is provided "as is" without any warranties, representations and/or assurances in respect of it. All such warranties, conditions, representations, assurances or other terms which might have effect between the parties or be implied or incorporated into this Licence or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, are hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law, including any implied conditions, warranties or other terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or the use of reasonable skill and care.</p>

<p>6.5. Subject to clause 6.6, if any Claim is made, or in Haulmont's reasonable opinion is likely to be made, against the Licensee, Haulmont may at its absolute discretion and expense:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.5.1. procure for the Licensee the right to continue to use the Software (or any part thereof) in accordance with the terms of this Licence;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.5.2. modify the Software so that it ceases to be infringing;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.5.3. replace the Software with non-infringing software; or</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">6.5.4. terminate this Licence immediately by notice in writing to the Licensee,</p>

<p>provided that if Haulmont modifies or replaces the Software, the Licensee shall have the same rights in respect thereof as it would have had under this Licence had the references to the date of this Licence been references to the date on which such modification or replacement was made.</p>

<p>6.6. Clauses 6.3 to 6.5 (inclusive) shall only apply if the total Licence Fees paid to Haulmont by the Licensee for its use of the Software under this agreement in the 60 months immediately prior to the date that the Licensee is first notified of the Claim exceed GBP £10,000 (ten thousand pounds sterling).</p>

<p>6.7. This clause 6 constitutes the Licensee's exclusive remedy and Haulmont's only liability in respect of Claims. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 6 is subject to the provisions of clause 5.</p>

<p><strong>7. Third party software</strong></p>

<p>7.1. The Software uses and is distributed with third party software libraries ("<strong>Third Party Libraries</strong>"). Haulmont is permitted to sub-licence the Third Party Libraries to the Licensee, provided that the Licensee complies with the terms on which the Third Party Libraries are licenced to Haulmont ("<strong>Third Party Terms</strong>"). Further information on Third Party Libraries used in the latest versions of the Software and Third Party Terms is provided at <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.com/en/documentation" target="_blank">www.cuba-platform.com/en/documentation</a>. The Licensee acknowledges and accepts that its use of the Software (including the supply of Derived Software to third parties) is subject to the Third Party Terms. The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Haulmont shall have no liability whatsoever for any unauthorised, illegal or unlawful use of any Third Party Libraries by the Licensee.</p>

<p>7.2. All Forks used in and distributed with the Software are sub-licensed to the Licensee on the same Third Party Terms as the corresponding Third Party Library modified by the relevant Forks.</p>
