                ANTLR 2 License

                We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual or company may do whatever they
                wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or
                its output, into commercial software.
                We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR.
                By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial product,
                research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc...
                If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In
                addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to
                continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.

            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

                THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

                1. DEFINITIONS

                "Contribution" means:

                a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
                b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
                i) changes to the Program, and
                ii) additions to the Program;
                where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
                "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

                "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

                "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

                "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

                2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

                a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
                b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
                c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
                d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
                3. REQUIREMENTS

                A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

                a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
                b) its license agreement:
                i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
                ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
                iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
                iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
                When the Program is made available in source code form:

                a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
                b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
                Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

                Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

                4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

                Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

                For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

                5. NO WARRANTY

                EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

                6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

                EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                7. GENERAL

                If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

                If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

                All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

                Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

                This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

            under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
            the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.
            Notwithstanding Section 2.2 (b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
            3. Distribution Obligations.

            3.1. Application of License.

            The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

            3.2. Availability of Source Code.

            Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

            3.3. Description of Modifications.

            You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

            3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

            (a) Third Party Claims

            If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

            (b) Contributor APIs

            If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

            (c) Representations.

            Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

            3.5. Required Notices.

            You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

            3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

            You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

            3.7. Larger Works.

            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

            4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

            If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

            5. Application of this License.

            This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

            6. Versions of the License.

            6.1. New Versions

            Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

            6.2. Effect of New Versions

            Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

            6.3. Derivative Works

            If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

            7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

            COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

            8. Termination

            8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

            8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

            such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
            any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
            8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

            8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

            9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

            10. U.S. government end users

            The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

            11. Miscellaneous

            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

            12. Responsibility for claims

            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

            13. Multiple-licensed code

            Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

            Exhibit A - Mozilla Public License.

        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
        Version 2.1, February 1999

        Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

        [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
        as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
        the version number 2.1.]

        Preamble

        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
        freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
        Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
        free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

        This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
        specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
        Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
        can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
        this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
        strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
        not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
        you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
        for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
        it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
        it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
        these things.

        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
        rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
        you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
        or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
        you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
        code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
        complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
        with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
        it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
        library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
        there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
        modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
        that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
        author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
        introduced by others.

        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
        any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
        effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
        restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
        any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
        consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
        ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
        is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
        this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
        libraries into non-free programs.

        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
        a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
        combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
        General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
        entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
        Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
        the library.

        We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
        does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
        Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
        of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
        are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
        libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
        special circumstances.

        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
        encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
        a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
        allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
        library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
        case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
        software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
        programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
        free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
        non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
        operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
        system.

        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
        users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
        linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
        that program using a modified version of the Library.

        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
        "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
        former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
        be combined with the library in order to run.

        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

        0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
        program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
        other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
        this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
        Each licensee is addressed as "you".

        A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
        (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

        The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
        which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
        Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
        copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
        portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
        straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
        included without limitation in the term "modification".)

        "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
        making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
        all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
        and installation of the library.

        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
        running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
        such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
        on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
        writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
        and what the program that uses the Library does.

        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
        complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
        you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
        all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
        warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
        Library.

        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
        and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
        fee.

        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.

        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)

        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
        and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
        themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
        sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
        on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
        this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
        it.

        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
        your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
        exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
        collective works based on the Library.

        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
        with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
        a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
        the scope of this License.

        3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
        License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
        this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
        that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
        instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
        ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
        that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
        these notices.

        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
        that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
        subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
        the Library into a program that is not a library.

        4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
        derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
        under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
        it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
        must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
        medium customarily used for software interchange.

        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
        source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
        distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

        5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
        Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
        linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
        work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
        therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

        However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
        contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
        library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
        Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

        When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
        that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
        derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
        Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
        linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
        threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
        structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
        functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
        file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
        work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
        Library will still fall under Section 6.)

        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
        distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
        Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
        whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

        6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
        link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
        work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
        under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
        modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications.

        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
        Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
        this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
        during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
        copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
        directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
        of these things:

        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)

        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.

        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.

        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

        For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
        Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
        reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
        the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
        normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
        which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
        the executable.

        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
        accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
        use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
        distribute.

        7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
        facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
        library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
        the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
        permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.

        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

        8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
        the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
        attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
        distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
        rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
        or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

        9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
        signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
        distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
        prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
        modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
        Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
        all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
        the Library or works based on it.

        10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
        Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
        subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
        restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
        You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
        this License.

        11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
        distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
        may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
        license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
        the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
        particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
        and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
        integrity of the free software distribution system which is
        implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
        impose that choice.

        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.

        12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
        original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
        an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
        so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
        excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
        written in the body of this License.

        13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
        Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
        "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
        the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
        license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
        the Free Software Foundation.

        14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
        write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
        Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
        decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
        of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
        and reuse of software generally.

        NO WARRANTY

        15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
        EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
        OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
        LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
        THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

        16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
        WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
        AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
        FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
        LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
        RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
        FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
        SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.

        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

        If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
        possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
        everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
        redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
        ordinary General Public License).

        To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
        safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
        "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
            Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

            This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
            modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
            License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
            version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

            This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
            Lesser General Public License for more details.

            You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
            License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
            Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

            Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

            You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
            school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
            necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

            Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
            library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

            <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990

            GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

            Version 3, 29 June 2007

            Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
            This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

            0. Additional Definitions.
            As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
            “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
            An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
            A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.
            The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
            The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

            1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
            You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

            2. Conveying Modified Versions.
            If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
            a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
            b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

            3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
            The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
            b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

            4. Combined Works.
            You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
            b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            d) Do one of the following:
            0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
            1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
            e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

            5. Combined Libraries.
            You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
            a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
            b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

            6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
            The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
            If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.


            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

            Version 3, 29 June 2007

            Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

            Preamble

            The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

            The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

            To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

            For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

            Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

            For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

            Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

            Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            0. Definitions.
            “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

            “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

            “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

            To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

            A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

            To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

            To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

            An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

            1. Source Code.
            The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

            A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

            The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

            The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

            The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

            2. Basic Permissions.
            All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

            You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

            3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
            No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

            When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

            4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
            You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

            You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

            5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
            You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

            a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
            b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
            c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
            d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
            A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

            6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
            You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

            a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
            b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
            c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
            d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
            e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

            A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

            “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

            7. Additional Terms.
            “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

            a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
            b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
            c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
            d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
            e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
            f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

            8. Termination.
            You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

            Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

            9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
            You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

            10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
            Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

            An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

            11. Patents.
            A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

            A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

            In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

            A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

            12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
            If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

            13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

            14. Revised Versions of this License.
            The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

            Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

            15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
            THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

            16. Limitation of Liability.
            IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

            17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
            If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                ]]>

            Common Public License - v 1.0

            THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
            LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
            CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

            1. DEFINITIONS

            "Contribution" means:

            a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
            documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
            b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

            i) changes to the Program, and

            ii) additions to the Program;

            where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
            distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
            Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
            acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
            the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
            conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
            not derivative works of the Program.

            "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

            "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
            necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
            combined with the Program.

            "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

            "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
            including all Contributors.

            2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

            a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
            Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
            reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
            distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
            such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

            b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
            Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
            Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
            transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
            object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
            Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
            Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
            covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
            other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
            licensed hereunder.

            c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
            licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by
            any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
            intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
            any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
            infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
            exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
            assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
            needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
            allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
            acquire that license before distributing the Program.

            d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
            copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
            set forth in this Agreement.

            3. REQUIREMENTS

            A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
            its own license agreement, provided that:

            a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

            b) its license agreement:

            i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
            conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
            and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
            and fitness for a particular purpose;

            ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
            damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
            damages, such as lost profits;

            iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

            iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
            Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on
            or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

            When the Program is made available in source code form:

            a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

            b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
            Program.

            Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
            Program.

            Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
            any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
            originator of the Contribution.

            4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

            Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
            respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
            intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
            includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
            which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
            a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
            Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
            every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
            and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
            actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
            extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
            connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
            offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
            relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
            to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
            Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
            to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
            any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
            participate in any such claim at its own expense.

            For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
            offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
            Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
            related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
            Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
            Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
            Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
            requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
            Contributor must pay those damages.

            5. NO WARRANTY

            EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
            "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
            IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
            NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
            Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
            and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise
            of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
            costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
            data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

            6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

            EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
            CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
            SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
            PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
            STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY
            WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
            GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

            7. GENERAL

            If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
            law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
            terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
            provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
            provision valid and enforceable.

            If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
            a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
            lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
            Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
            is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
            entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
            Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
            hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
            granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
            filed.

            All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
            comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
            not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
            such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
            Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
            reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
            and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
            and survive.

            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
            order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
            modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
            publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
            No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
            IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to
            serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
            of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
            (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of
            the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
            the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
            (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
            in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to
            the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
            expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
            expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

            This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
            intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
            Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
            after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
            in any resulting litigation.

            "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
            "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
            "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
            "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
            "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
            "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
            "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
            "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

            2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

            3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

            to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
            to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
            to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
            to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

            For the avoidance of doubt:
            Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
            Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
            Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

            The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

            4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

            You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
            If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
            Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

            5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

            UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

            6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

            7. Termination

            This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
            Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

            8. Miscellaneous

            Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
            Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
            If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
            No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
            This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
            The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

            4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
            this License.

            4.2. Effect of New Versions.

            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
            Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
            License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
            the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
            prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
            under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
            of the License under which You originally received the Covered
            Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
            otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
            subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

            4.3. Modified Versions.

            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
            license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
            modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
            remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
            note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
            make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
            License.

            5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

            COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
            IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
            NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
            THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
            DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
            OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
            REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
            ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
            AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

            6. TERMINATION.

            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
            automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
            cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
            Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
            termination of this License shall survive.

            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
            declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
            Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
            assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
            Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
            Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
            Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
            infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
            indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
            Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
            Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
            from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
            expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
            day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
            Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
            a written agreement with Participant.

            6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
            alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
            infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
            license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
            infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
            granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
            into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
            license.

            6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
            all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
            distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
            granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

            7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
            (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
            COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
            TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
            FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
            LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
            APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
            PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
            LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
            LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
            AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

            8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

            The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
            in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
            software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
            252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
            as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
            with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
            (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
            with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
            clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
            clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
            software under this License.

            9. MISCELLANEOUS.

            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
            matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
            unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
            necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
            the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
            the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
            provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
            provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
            to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
            venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
            with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
            limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
            The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
            the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
            regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
            construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
            agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
            States export administration regulations (and the export control
            laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
            or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

            10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
            responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
            out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
            work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
            responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
            shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

            --------------------------------

            2.1. Grants

            Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
            non-exclusive license:

            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

            as part of a Larger Work; and

            (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
            for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.

            2.2. Effective Date

            The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
            become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
            distributes such Contribution.

            2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

            The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
            this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
            distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
            Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
            Contributor:

            (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
            or

            (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or

            (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.

            This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
            or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
            the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

            2.4. Subsequent Licenses

            No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
            distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
            License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
            permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

            2.5. Representation

            Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
            Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
            to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

            2.6. Fair Use

            This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
            applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
            equivalents.

            2.7. Conditions

            Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
            in Section 2.1.

            3. Responsibilities
            -------------------

            3.1. Distribution of Source Form

            All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
            Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
            the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
            Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
            License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
            attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
            Form.

            3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

            If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

            (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

            (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

            3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

            You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
            provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
            the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
            Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
            Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
            License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
            under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
            the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
            Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
            License(s).

            3.4. Notices

            You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
            (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
            or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
            the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
            the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

            3.5. Application of Additional Terms

            You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
            indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
            Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
            behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
            such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
            liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
            indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
            disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
            jurisdiction.

            4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
            ---------------------------------------------------

            If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
            License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
            statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
            the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
            describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
            be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
            Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
            or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
            recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

            5. Termination
            --------------

            5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
            if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
            compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
            Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
            Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
            ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
            non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
            come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
            Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
            notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
            first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
            from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
            Your receipt of the notice.

            5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
            infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
            counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
            directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
            You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
            2.1 of this License shall terminate.

            5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
            end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
            have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
            prior to termination shall survive termination.

            8. Litigation
            -------------

            Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
            courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
            place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
            jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
            Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
            cross-claims or counter-claims.

            9. Miscellaneous
            ----------------

            This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
            matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
            unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
            necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
            that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
            shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

            10. Versions of the License
            ---------------------------

            10.1. New Versions

            Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
            10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
            publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
            distinguishing version number.

            10.2. Effect of New Versions

            You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
            of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
            or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
            steward.

            10.3. Modified Versions

            If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
            create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
            modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
            any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
            such modified license differs from this License).

            10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
            Licenses

            If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
            Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
            notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
