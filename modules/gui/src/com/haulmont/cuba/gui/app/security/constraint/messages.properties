joinClauseHelp=A value of this field is added to the "from" query clause. It should begin with a comma, "join" or "left join".<br/>\
  The {E} placeholder should be used as an alias of the entity being extracted. On execution of the query, it will be replaced with a real alias, specified in the query.<br/><br/>\
  For example:<br/>\
  <code>join {E}.seller s</code>

whereClauseHelp=A value of this field is added to the "where" query clause using "and" condition. The "where" word is not needed, as it will be added automatically.<br/>\
  The {E} placeholder should be used as an alias of the entity being extracted. On execution of the query, it will be replaced with a real alias, specified in the query.<br/>\
  The following predefined constants can be used in JPQL parameters:<ul>\
  <li><code>session$userLogin</code> – login name of the current user (in case of substitution – the login name of the substituted user).</li>\
  <li><code>session$userId</code> – ID of the current user (in case of substitution – ID of the substituted user).</li>\
  <li><code>session$userGroupId</code> – group ID of the current user (in case of substitution − group ID of the substituted user).</li>\
  <li><code>session$XYZ</code> – an arbitrary attribute of the current user session, where XYZ is the attribute name.</li></ul>\
  For example:<br/>\
  <code>{E}.createdBy = :session$userLogin and s.code = 'abc'</code>

groovyScriptHelp=Here you can set Groovy-script with a condition for the selected type of entity and selected operation type.\
  <br/> The {E} placeholder should be used as an alias of the entity.\
  <br/> The script should check whether the certain operation is available for the entity or not, and return true (if available) or false (if not available).\
  <br/>\
  <br/> For example <code>{E}.name <> 'Test'</code> will deny the action for any entity with name "Test".
